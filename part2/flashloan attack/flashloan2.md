# The Value DeFi Incident

Value DeFi, a decentralised finance platform, was compromised in another flashloan assault in 2020. The attacker took use of a flaw in the smart contract of the platform to manipulate the system and profit from the flashloan.

Through a flashloan, the attacker obtained a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, which they then exploited to alter the platform's token's value. The attacker generated a considerable deviation in the price of the targeted token from its actual market value by fabricating artificial imbalances in supply and demand. They were able to conduct deals at advantageous rates because to this manipulation, which made them profitable.

In response to the situation, Value DeFi strengthened the security of its smart contracts and added safeguards to stop similar breaches. This event brought home how crucial security is always.
